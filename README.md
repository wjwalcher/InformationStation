# InformationStation

A Python/Arduino project to get useful information and display it on an LED matrix(e.g. time, date, weather, stock prices, and anything in between!). The InformationStation scrapes information from websites using RegEx and Python, takes this information, and then sends it to an Arduino program, where it can be used as an output for a scrolling LED matrix.
